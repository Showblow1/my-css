<h1>Cadillac Celestiq</h1>
<p>We’ve told you about the Cadillac Celestiq—an all-electric, six-figure, and flagship sedan concept from General Motors’ premier division. But this was the first time we had a chance to see it in person, and, shockingly, it has even more presence up close. The production version should be unveiled later this year.</p>

<h1>McLaren collection:</h1>
<p style="color: gold;">The McLaren F1 was a mid-engine sports car manufactured from 1992 to 1998, with a total of 106 cars being produced. Due to the extremely limited number of production, the cars are extremely rare and are valued between US$8 million to $13.5 Million. The Sultan of Brunei purchased ten of the 106 McLaren F1s produced, and these included five road cars, three F1 LMs, one F1 GT, and one F1 GTR. Despite Gordon Murray's desire for all F1 LMs to be completed in Historic Orange, out of all three F1 LMs first requested, two of them are done in a unique livery. The sultan still owns the lone LM of the two non-historic oranges. Since the heyday of the collection, only six Mclarens remain. One of the unique livery F1 LMs has been reported in the Sultan of Johor's collection, while one roadcar was wrecked and then scrapped. Two F1 roadcars have been sold and are now located abroad.</p>

<h1>Bentley Bacalar</h1>
<p>With just 12 total units produced, the Bentley Bacalar makes some of the "limited" cars on this list look plentiful by comparison. Although the car’s opulent design may be the first thing to grab your attention, the Bacalar is no slouch in terms of performance either. With Bentley’s signature turbocharged 6.0-liter W-12 turbocharged engine, this car delivers 650 horsepower and 664 pound-feet. If you have a spare $1.9 million lying around and are considering buying one, you’re already too late—Bentley says that every example is now in customer hands.</p> -->

<h1>Czinger 21C V Max</h1>
<p style="color: blue;">Czinger could be just another fantastical seven-figure hypercar-maker, rolling out evanescent concepts. But its uniqueness is in its manufacturing process: The cars are 3D printed. These two fresh hybrid models are a version of the 21C, optimized for top speed, and a four-seat grand touring vehicle.</p>

<h1 style="color: red;">Bugatti Mistral W16</h1>
<p style="color: yellow;">Making a topless version of the outrageous Chiron hypercar isn’t as simple as removing the roof. For the $5-million Mistral, Bugatti designers created an entirely original vehicle, front to back. We’re especially fond of the wraparound windshield, the stubby rear end, and the wild X-shaped taillights.</p>

<h1 style="color: red;">BMW M4 CSL</h1>
<p style="color: purple;">BMW’s Competition Sports Lightweight (CSL) cars are track-ready with weight removed and power added. This latest version of the brand’s M4 sports coupe adheres to that recipe, with output increased to a rousing 543 hp and weight lowered by nearly 250 pounds. Only a thousand of these cars will be offered, starting at $140,895.</p>

<h1 style="color: red;">Audi Sphere Cars</h1>
<p style="color: green;">Looking toward our electrified—and, perhaps one day, our self-driving—automotive future, the four-ring brand has, over the past few years, previewed a trio of concepts: an urban runabout, a luxury sedan, and a lifestyle convertible grand tourer. All three were gathered together this year for the first time.</p>

<h1 style="color: red;">Aston Martin Vantage V12 Roadster</h1>
<p style="color: blueviolet;">To celebrate the 10th anniversary of its Q division—which creates limited-edition vehicles for top clients—Aston Martin showed this coach-built open car influenced by its winning 1950s race cars. Also on hand was a production-ready version of its menacing Vantage V12, now in convertible form.</p>
